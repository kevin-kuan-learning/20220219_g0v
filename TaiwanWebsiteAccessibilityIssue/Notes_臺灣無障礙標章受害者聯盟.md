## About

為保障身心障礙者資訊取得之權利，立法院決議要求各級政府機關與學校於建置之網站新設或改版時，應依據國家通訊傳播委員會頒訂之「無障礙網頁開發規範2.0版」檢測等級 AA 以上進行設計。
基本的親和力設計，例如替代文字、tabindex 等，確實有助於身心障礙者便於取得資訊，然而，強制所有網站直上 AA 等級，此舉將造成簡單、目標小眾的服務也因而必須墊高成本。
歡迎有興趣關注此議題的人加入。

The government has made a law that all government departments and schools websites have to conform to the "website accessibility support guidelines 2.0" with a level of AA or higher. *rest ignored*
However, this restriction to enforce AA level will raise costs for some simple services, which do not have the resources.

## What I think

- It looks like the website developers know what to do. It is just really taxing to work with the government, trying to fulfill restrictions.
- The government is pushing government agencies and schools. No need to worry about that. But if we want to stress some points about window.alert() and text in pictures, we could do that.
